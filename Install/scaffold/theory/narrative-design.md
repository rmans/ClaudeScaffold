Principles for storytelling in games — how to deliver narrative through interactive systems.

---

## Story vs Narrative

- Story is what happens — the sequence of events, the plot. Narrative is how the player experiences those events — the order, the framing, the perspective, the gaps left for interpretation.
- Games are unique among storytelling media because the player is not an audience member — they are a participant. Design for the player to be inside the narrative, not watching it.
- Player agency and authored story exist in permanent tension. The writer wants to tell a specific story; the player wants to make their own choices. Do not pretend this tension away — lean into it. The best game narratives make the player feel like they are choosing the story the writer intended.
- Linear stories are not failures of interactivity. A tightly authored narrative with zero branching can still feel deeply personal if the player's actions within the world carry weight moment to moment.
- The player's internal narrative — the story they tell themselves about what they did and why — is often more powerful than the authored plot. Give them reasons to build that internal story.

## Environmental Storytelling

- The world tells stories without words. A knocked-over chair, a half-eaten meal, graffiti on a wall, a locked door with scratch marks — these details communicate history, mood, and stakes faster than dialogue ever could.
- "Show don't tell" applies doubly in games because the player can choose where to look. Reward observation. Place narrative details where a curious player will find them, not where every player is forced to see them.
- Every room should tell a micro-story. Before populating a space with assets, answer: who was here, what were they doing, and what happened to them? Even if the player never consciously registers the answer, the space will feel coherent.
- Environmental storytelling is most effective when it contrasts with expectations. A children's toy in a war zone. A lavish feast in an abandoned house. Dissonance between the environment and its context creates unease without a single line of dialogue.
- Use environmental changes to mark player impact. If the player's actions alter the world — burned buildings, displaced NPCs, new graffiti — the environment becomes proof that the player's choices mattered.

## Dialogue Design

- Keep lines short. Players read faster than characters speak, and long monologues invite skipping. If a line cannot fit in a single subtitle bar without shrinking the font, it is too long.
- Every dialogue option the player is offered should feel meaningfully distinct. If two options produce the same response or differ only in tone without consequence, the player learns that choosing does not matter. That lesson poisons every future dialogue.
- Player dialogue should reflect what the player already knows, not repeat exposition the game just delivered. If a cutscene showed the bridge collapse, the player's dialogue option should not be "What happened to the bridge?" It should be "The bridge is gone — now what?"
- Barks — short contextual lines triggered by gameplay events — do more worldbuilding per word than cutscenes. A guard muttering "Third patrol this week..." or a shopkeeper saying "You look like you've been in the wastes" builds a living world in seconds.
- Write dialogue for the ear, not the page. Read every line aloud. If it sounds stilted or overwritten when spoken, rewrite it. Characters should sound like people, not like exposition delivery systems.

## Branching and Consequence

- True branching — where the narrative permanently diverges into separate content — is expensive to produce and most players will only see one path. Use full branches where they matter most: the ending, a major character's fate, the resolution of a central theme.
- Delayed consequences feel more impactful than immediate ones. A choice made in act one that pays off in act three teaches the player that the game is paying attention. Immediate cause-and-effect feels transactional by comparison.
- The illusion of choice — where both paths converge but feel different along the way — is a valid and powerful tool when used honestly. Different dialogue, different context, different emotional texture on the same plot beat can make two players feel they had entirely different experiences.
- Flag and payoff is the core technique. Plant flags early (the player saved someone, chose a faction, told a lie), then pay them off later with changed dialogue, altered encounters, or shifted NPC attitudes. Small payoffs across many flags feel richer than one massive branch.
- Communicate consequences without spelling them out. "The villagers remember your kindness" is a flag notification. The real payoff is when they shelter you later without explanation — and you realize why.

## Pacing Narrative

- Alternate between tension and relief. A story that is always intense becomes numbing. A story that never escalates becomes flat. Map the emotional arc across the full runtime, not just the main quest.
- Let the player breathe between story beats. After a major revelation, a character death, or a climactic battle, give the player a quiet space — a walk through town, a conversation with a friend, a moment of mundane normalcy. Recovery is where the player processes what happened.
- Do not frontload lore. The player cares about the world's history after they care about their current situation. Drip context gradually: each new piece of lore should reframe something the player already experienced.
- Gameplay sections without explicit narrative are not dead space — silence builds anticipation. A long stretch of exploration or combat without dialogue makes the next story beat hit harder by contrast.
- The player controls the pace. They might sprint through the critical path or spend hours exploring side content between main quests. Design narrative beats that work regardless of how much time has elapsed since the last one. Avoid "urgent" framing that the player can ignore for twenty hours.

## Character Design

- Characters need wants, not just backstories. A character defined by what happened to them is static. A character defined by what they are trying to achieve is dynamic. Wants create goals, goals create conflict, conflict creates story.
- Memorable characters have a clear silhouette — both visual and personality. You should be able to identify a character by their posture alone, and you should be able to predict their reaction to a situation after knowing them for five minutes. Specificity creates memorability.
- NPCs should react to player actions. A companion who watches the player commit atrocities without comment breaks immersion worse than a graphical glitch. Even a simple disapproval line acknowledges that the world is watching.
- Companions and major NPCs should have opinions that sometimes conflict with the player. Agreement is comfortable; disagreement is interesting. A companion who challenges the player's choices forces the player to consider their own motivations.
- Avoid the "chosen one" default. Characters who exist only to serve the player feel hollow. NPCs with their own agendas, schedules, and relationships — even simple ones — make the world feel inhabited rather than staged.

## Lore Delivery

- Lore is optional context, not required reading. The main narrative should be fully comprehensible to a player who ignores every codex entry, audio log, and readable note. Lore enriches — it must never gatekeep.
- Codex and journal entries work when they are short and reward curiosity. A 200-word entry that reframes a location the player already visited is compelling. A 2000-word history of a kingdom the player has never seen is homework.
- Audio logs, letters, and found documents should feel natural in the world. Ask whether the document makes sense existing where you placed it. A soldier's letter in a barracks, yes. A villain's manifesto conveniently left on a desk in their secret lair, no.
- Never gate progression behind lore comprehension. If solving a puzzle requires information buried in a codex entry, the puzzle is poorly designed. The player should be able to solve it through observation and deduction, with the codex providing satisfying confirmation.
- Lore should raise questions as often as it answers them. Each piece of worldbuilding that opens a new mystery pulls the curious player deeper. A world fully explained is a world with nothing left to discover.

## Ludonarrative Consistency

- Mechanics should reinforce the story's themes. If the narrative is about survival and scarcity, resource management mechanics make that theme felt, not just told. If the narrative is about building community, mechanics that reward cooperation over competition align form with content.
- Ludonarrative dissonance — where gameplay contradicts narrative — erodes believability. If the story says killing is wrong but gameplay showers the player with rewards for every kill, the player trusts the mechanics over the words. They always do.
- Use mechanics to make the player feel what the character feels. A stamina system makes exhaustion tangible. An inventory limit makes scarcity real. A timer makes urgency visceral. The most powerful narratives in games are the ones the player experiences through systems, not cutscenes.
- Systemic storytelling — narrative that emerges from the interaction of gameplay systems rather than scripted events — is the medium's unique strength. A rivalry that forms because two AI factions keep clashing near the player's base is more memorable than most scripted rivalries.
- When dissonance is unavoidable, acknowledge it rather than ignoring it. A character commenting on the absurdity of the situation, or a mechanic that at least gestures toward the narrative reality, is better than pretending the contradiction does not exist.
