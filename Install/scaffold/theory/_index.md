# Theory — Index

> **Layer:** Reference only — never canonical.
> **Authority:** Rank 11 (lowest). Theory informs decisions but never dictates them.

## Rules

- Theory documents are reference material only.
- They carry no authority over design, engine, or implementation decisions.
- Cite theory docs in ADRs when they influence a decision, but the ADR is what carries authority.
- No other document is required to conform to theory.
