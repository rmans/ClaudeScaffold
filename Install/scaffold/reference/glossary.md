## Purpose

Canonical terminology for this project. When a term is defined here, all documents, code, and conversations must use it consistently. The "NOT" column is just as important as the definition — it prevents drift toward ambiguous synonyms.

## Terms

<!-- Add terms as they emerge. Alphabetical order. -->

| Term | Definition | NOT (do not use) |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| *None yet* | — | — |

<!-- Example entries:
| Colonist | A player-controlled settler living in the colony | Pawn, NPC, character, unit, villager |
| Blueprint | A placed but unbuilt object awaiting construction | Ghost, plan, placeholder, template |
| Stockpile | A designated zone for storing resources | Warehouse, storage, chest, container |
| Mood break | An uncontrolled behavior triggered by critically low mood | Mental break, tantrum, meltdown, snap |
| Downed | A colonist at 0 HP, incapacitated but not dead | Dead, knocked out, unconscious, KO'd |
| Tick | One simulation step (not a rendered frame) | Frame, update, cycle, step |
-->

## Rules

1. **If it's in this glossary, use the exact term.** No synonyms in docs or code. Variable names, signal names, UI labels — all match the glossary.
2. **The NOT column is enforced.** If you see a "NOT" term in a document or codebase, replace it with the canonical term.
3. **New terms should be added early.** If you find yourself explaining what a word means, it belongs in the glossary.
4. **Terms can be renamed via ADR.** If a better term emerges, file an ADR, update the glossary, and update all references.
