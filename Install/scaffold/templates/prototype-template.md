## Question

<!-- ONE specific, answerable question this prototype exists to resolve. -->
<!-- Bad: "How should combat work?" — too broad, that's a system design. -->
<!-- Good: "Can the damage calculation run within 2ms per frame with 50 active entities?" -->

TODO: State the single question this prototype answers.

## Hypothesis

<!-- What you expect the answer to be, and why. -->

TODO: State your expected answer and the reasoning behind it.

## Scope: Build

<!-- The MINIMUM work needed to answer the question. Numbered steps. -->

TODO: List the minimum steps to answer the question.

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Scope: Skip

<!-- Explicit exclusions — what you are NOT building. This is a discipline boundary. -->

TODO: List what is explicitly out of scope for this spike.

## Approach

<!-- Numbered steps for executing the spike. Optional: include a time box. -->

TODO: Describe the approach.

## Design Impact

<!-- Which scaffold documents need to change based on findings? -->

TODO: List impacted documents and what needs to change.

| Document | What Changes | Severity |

## ADRs Filed

<!-- ADR-### entries created from findings. Each design impact should produce an ADR. -->

## Disposition

<!-- Discarded (code deleted) / Archived (kept for reference) / Absorbed (merged via TASK-###) -->
