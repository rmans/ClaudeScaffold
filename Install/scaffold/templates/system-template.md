## Purpose

<!-- One sentence: why does this system exist? What fantasy or need does it serve? -->

## Player Intent

<!-- What is the player trying to accomplish when they engage with this system? Bullet list. -->

## Player Actions

<!-- Step by step, what does the player actually do? Write this as a numbered sequence of observable actions. No implementation details — only what the player sees and does. -->

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## System Resolution

<!-- What happens after the player acts? How does the game world respond? Describe the chain of visible consequences. -->

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Failure / Friction States

<!-- What can go wrong? What does the player see when things stall, break, or fail? How does the game communicate the problem? -->

- ...

## Inputs & Dependencies

<!-- What other systems feed INTO this one? Describe at the design level (not signals/methods — those belong in interfaces.md). -->

| Source System | What It Provides |
|---------------|------------------|
| ... | ... |

## Outputs & Consequences

<!-- What does this system feed OUT to other systems? What ripple effects does it create? -->

| Target System | What It Receives |
|---------------|------------------|
| ... | ... |

## Non-Responsibilities

<!-- What this system explicitly does NOT own. Prevents scope creep. -->

- ...

## Edge Cases & Player Questions

<!-- Questions a player would naturally ask. Answer them here so the design is unambiguous. -->

- *Can I...?*
- *What happens if...?*

## Feel & Feedback

<!-- How should this system feel to use? What's the feedback language — visual, audio, haptic? What makes it satisfying? -->

- ...

## Open Questions

<!-- Unresolved design questions. Remove entries as they are resolved. -->
