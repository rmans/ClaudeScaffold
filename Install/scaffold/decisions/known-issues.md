# Known Issues

## Purpose

Living tracker of TBDs, gaps, and conflicts found during design or implementation. This is the place to log things that are unresolved — not a bug tracker, but a design-level issue list. Items here represent missing decisions, ambiguous requirements, or contradictions between documents.

## Open Issues

<!-- Add issues as they are discovered. Remove them when resolved (move to Resolved section). -->

| ID | Category | Description | Discovered In | Blocking | Status |
|----|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| *None yet* | — | — | — | — | — |

<!-- Example entries:
| KI-001 | Gap       | No system owns weather effects on construction speed | SYS-001 Construction | Balance params | Open |
| KI-002 | Conflict  | authority.md says Health owns bleed_rate but state-transitions.md implies Needs does | authority.md, state-transitions.md | SYS-003 Health | Open |
| KI-003 | TBD       | What happens to carried resources when a colonist is downed? | SYS-005 Job Queue | SYS-001, SYS-004 | Open |
-->

## Categories

- **Gap** — Something that should be defined but isn't. Missing system, missing state, missing rule.
- **Conflict** — Two documents disagree. One or both need updating.
- **TBD** — A decision was explicitly deferred. Needs resolution before implementation.
- **Ambiguity** — A document can be read multiple ways. Needs clarification.

## Resolved Issues

<!-- Move resolved issues here with a note on how they were resolved. -->

| ID | Description | Resolution | Resolved By |
|----|-------------|------------|-------------|
| *None yet* | — | — | — |

## Rules

1. **Log early, resolve later.** It's always better to log an issue than to forget it. Resolution can wait.
2. **Link to the source.** Every issue should reference where it was discovered.
3. **Don't duplicate.** Check if an existing issue covers the same problem before adding a new one.
4. **Resolved means resolved.** Don't mark an issue resolved until the fix is in the relevant documents — not just discussed.
