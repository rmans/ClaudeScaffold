## Purpose

Living tracker of playtester observations, patterns, and actions taken. This is the place to log what testers actually do and say — not your interpretation, not your solution. Observations flow in, patterns emerge, and actions are taken when the data demands it.

## Open Feedback

<!-- Add feedback entries as they are observed during playtesting. Move to Resolved when addressed. -->

| ID | Type | Observation | System/Spec | Severity | Frequency | Source | Status |
|----|------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| *None yet* | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

<!-- Example entries:
| PF-001 | Confusion   | Testers don't realize they can rotate buildings before placing    | SYS-004 Building   | High   | 3/4 | PT-2025-03-15 | Pattern |
| PF-002 | Frustration | Health bar obscures action buttons on small screens               | SYS-003 Health     | Medium | 2/5 | PT-2025-03-15 | Open    |
| PF-003 | Delight     | Players laugh when colonists stumble carrying oversized items     | SYS-006 Carry      | Low    | 4/4 | PT-2025-03-20 | Open    |
| PF-004 | Suggestion  | "It would be cool if you could queue up multiple build orders"    | SYS-004 Building   | Low    | 1/4 | PT-2025-03-15 | Open    |
| PF-005 | Bug         | Tester clicked rapidly and triggered double resource deduction    | SYS-002 Resources  | High   | 1/4 | PT-2025-03-20 | Open    |

## Observation Types

- **Confusion** — Tester doesn't understand what to do or what happened. They pause, re-read, or ask questions.
- **Frustration** — Tester knows what to do but can't do it. They retry, sigh, or express annoyance.
- **Delight** — Tester reacts positively. They smile, laugh, say "cool," or repeat the action for fun.
- **Suggestion** — Tester proposes an idea or feature. Log the request but don't treat it as a requirement.
- **Bug** — Tester encounters unexpected or broken behavior. Overlaps with known issues but originates from observation.

## Patterns (Rule of Three)

<!-- When 3+ testers independently report the same observation, promote it here. Patterns demand action. -->

| ID | Type | Pattern | Frequency | Action Taken |
|----|------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| *None yet* | — | — | — | — |

<!-- Example entries:
| PF-001 | Confusion | Building rotation not discoverable — 3/4 testers missed it | 3/4 | Added tooltip on first build placement (SPEC-012) |
-->

## Resolved Feedback

<!-- Move resolved entries here with a note on how they were addressed. -->

| ID | Type | Observation | Resolution | Resolved In |
|----|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| *None yet* | — | — | — | — |

## Playtest Sessions Log

<!-- Log every playtest session here. Use session IDs in feedback entries to trace back to the session. -->

| Session ID | Date | Type | Testers | Focus Area | Phase |
|------------|------|------|---------|------------|-------|
| *None yet* | — | — | — | — | — |

<!-- Example entries:
| PT-2025-03-15 | 2025-03-15 | In-person | 4 | Core loop, building placement | P1-001 |
| PT-2025-03-20 | 2025-03-20 | Remote    | 5 | Inventory management, carry    | P1-001 |
-->

## Rules

1. **Observations, not prescriptions.** Log what testers did and said — not what you think the solution is. "Tester didn't notice the rotate button" is good. "We need a bigger rotate button" is not an observation.
2. **Log early, analyze later.** It's always better to log a raw observation than to wait until you've figured out the pattern.
3. **Rule of Three.** A single tester's observation is data. Three testers reporting the same thing is a pattern. Patterns demand action — promote to the Patterns table.
4. **Delight is data.** Positive reactions are just as important as problems. Log what players enjoy so you can protect and amplify it.
5. **Don't duplicate.** Check if an existing entry covers the same observation. If the same issue appears again, update the frequency count instead of adding a new row.
