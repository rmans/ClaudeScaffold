## Palette

<!-- Define named colors with hex values. Group by role (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, etc.). -->

*TODO: Define color palette.*

## Color Tokens

<!-- Named semantic tokens that map to palette colors. Tokens are what the game actually references — not raw hex values. Examples: `color-health`, `color-danger`, `color-xp`, `color-bg-panel`. -->

*TODO: Define color tokens.*

## Usage Rules

<!-- When and where each color or token is used. Semantic roles (primary action, destructive action, success, warning, info, disabled). Rules like "red is only for danger/health" or "accent is only for interactive elements." -->

*TODO: Define color usage rules.*

## UI vs World Colors

<!-- How the color system applies differently to UI elements vs in-world rendering. UI colors are typically flat and readable. World colors follow lighting, shading, and environmental context. Define the boundary. -->

*TODO: Define UI vs world color rules.*

## Accessibility

<!-- Minimum contrast ratios for text and interactive elements. Colorblind considerations — never rely on color alone to convey meaning. How color-deficient players distinguish health from mana, friend from enemy. -->

*TODO: Define accessibility requirements.*

## Theme Variants

<!-- If applicable: light/dark modes, faction colors, seasonal themes, biome-specific palettes. How do variants override the base palette? -->

*TODO: Define theme variants (if any).*
