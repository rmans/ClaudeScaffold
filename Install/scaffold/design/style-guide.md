This document defines the game's **visual identity** — what it looks like, how it feels to the eye. It is engine-agnostic and describes intent, not implementation.

> **Note:** Code style, naming conventions, and file organization are implementation concerns. They belong in the engine layer (`scaffold/engine/`), not here.

## Art Direction

<!-- Overall visual identity. What does the game look like at a glance? Reference images, mood boards, influences. -->

*TODO: Define art direction.*

## Visual Tone

<!-- How the visuals make the player feel. Dark and gritty? Bright and whimsical? Clean and minimalist? Nostalgic? -->

*TODO: Define visual tone.*

## Rendering Approach

<!-- 2D or 3D? Pixel art, hand-drawn, low-poly, realistic? Perspective (top-down, isometric, side-scroll, free camera)? -->

*TODO: Define rendering approach.*

## Character & Entity Style

<!-- How characters, creatures, and objects look. Proportions, level of detail, silhouette philosophy. How do you tell entities apart at a glance? -->

*TODO: Define character and entity visual style.*

## Environment Style

<!-- How the world looks. Biome palettes, architectural style, terrain approach, lighting mood. Indoor vs outdoor distinction. -->

*TODO: Define environment visual style.*

## VFX & Particles

<!-- Explosion style, magic effects, weather, hit feedback. Visual language for game events. How flashy or subtle? -->

*TODO: Define VFX style.*

## Animation Style

<!-- Snappy or weighty? Frame count philosophy for sprites, or curve style for 3D. Idle behavior, transitions, anticipation frames. -->

*TODO: Define animation style.*
