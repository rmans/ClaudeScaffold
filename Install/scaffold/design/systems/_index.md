# Systems — Index

## Purpose

Each system describes a major player-facing behavior in the game — what the player does, what the game does in response, and how it connects to other systems. Systems are written in player-visible behavior, not implementation. Technical contracts (signals, methods, data) live in [interfaces.md](../interfaces.md).

## Registered Systems

<!-- Add systems as they are designed. Keep in sync with the System Design Index in design-doc.md. -->

## Adding a System

1. Use the [system template](../../templates/system-template.md).
2. Assign the next SYS-### ID.
3. Save the file in this directory as `SYS-###-name.md`.
4. Register it in the table above **and** in the System Design Index in [design-doc.md](../design-doc.md).
