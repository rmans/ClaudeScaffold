## Purpose

High-level principles that guide all input design decisions. Why we make the input choices we do.

## Principles

<!-- Define the guiding principles for input design. Examples:

1. **Actions, not keys.** Code references semantic actions, never raw keys.
2. **Device-agnostic.** All gameplay must be playable on keyboard and gamepad.
3. **Remappable by default.** Players can remap all gameplay actions.
4. **Prompts match device.** Button prompts reflect the active input device.

## Responsiveness

<!-- Targets for how inputs should feel. Examples:

- **Input-to-action latency:** ≤ 2 frames (33 ms at 60 fps).
- **Input buffering window:** 100 ms — queued inputs execute on the next valid frame.
- **Coyote time:** 80 ms — jump still registers briefly after leaving a ledge.
- **Cancel window:** Actions with wind-up can be cancelled within the first X ms.

*TODO: Define responsiveness targets.*

## Accessibility

<!-- Input accessibility requirements. Examples:

- All actions support remapping, including UI navigation.
- No actions require simultaneous button presses (chords).
- Hold-to-activate actions offer a toggle alternative.
- Color-coded input prompts have a text/icon fallback.
- Stick sensitivity and deadzone are player-adjustable.

## Constraints

<!-- Hard rules that apply to all input decisions. -->
