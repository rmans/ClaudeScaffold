## Purpose

Default gamepad bindings for all actions. These are the out-of-the-box defaults — players may remap at runtime.

## Bindings

<!-- Define bindings by namespace. Format:

### player_ Actions

| Action ID | Button/Axis |
|-----------|-------------|
| `player_move_left` | Left Stick Left |
| `player_move_right` | Left Stick Right |
| `player_jump` | A (South) |

-->

*TODO: Define gamepad bindings.*

## Rules

1. Every action in [action-map.md](action-map.md) must have a binding here.
2. Use generic button names (South, East, etc.) where possible.
3. Stick deadzones are defined in the engine input system doc (`engine/[engine]-input-system.md`).
