# Default Bindings — Keyboard & Mouse

## Purpose

Default keyboard and mouse bindings for all actions. These are the out-of-the-box defaults — players may remap at runtime.

## Bindings

<!-- Define bindings by namespace. Format:

### player_ Actions

| Action ID | Key/Button |
|-----------|------------|
| `player_move_left` | A / Left Arrow |
| `player_move_right` | D / Right Arrow |
| `player_jump` | Space |

-->

*TODO: Define keyboard & mouse bindings.*

## Rules

1. Every action in [action-map.md](action-map.md) must have a binding here.
2. Avoid conflicts within the same context.
3. Modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) should be used sparingly.
