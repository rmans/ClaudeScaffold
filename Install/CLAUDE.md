## Scaffold Retrieval Protocol

1. Start at `scaffold/_index.md` to locate the correct directory.
2. Open the directory's `_index.md` to find the specific document.
3. Read only the document(s) you need — avoid loading entire directories.
4. If two documents conflict, the higher-authority document wins (see `scaffold/doc-authority.md`).
